# Double Pendulum Simulator
## Written in: 
C++, C, and used Raylib 
## Why Raylib?
Raylib is a simplistic, but very powerful graphics framework generally used to make games, but it does not always need to be games, however. 
## Quick Notes:
This is my first time using Raylib and I  *do not* plan to use it further, rather this was simply a way to introduce my self to the semantics of C++ application development by using a simple-to-use framework such as Raylib. 
### Future Endeavors: 
Move on from Raylib and try to create my first Cellular *Automata* simulation using Qt, an extremely popular GUI builder and is the industry standard for C++ GUI software development. -- UPDATE: Completed
